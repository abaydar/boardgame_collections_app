# Welcome to Board Game Collections (BCG)

### Short Description

This web application was designed to keep track of all the board games a person owns.  It is encouraged to view the collections of other users to get exposed to more board games and see which ones would be a good fit in your collection.

To sign up for an account, ou will need a unique username, email, and password.

Once you are logged in, you can add as many board games to your collection as you'd like by either adding an existing game or creating a new one that's not yet in the database.  Please note you can only edit or delete board games you have created!

Your home page `My BGC` will show all of the games in your collection. Here you are able to remove a game you've gotten rid of, or add a game if you've purchased a new one.
